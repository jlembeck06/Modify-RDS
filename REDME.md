# Modify-RDS
Modify RDS Size and Parameter Group using step function workflow.
The main objective is to reduce manual intervention by allowing the step function to execute the entire RDS class and parameter group change flow. Instance Class and PG changes are performed when there is a need to execute a process that requires greater computational power.
